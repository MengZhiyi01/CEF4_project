## Abstract

This report provides a detailed description of the design, implementation, and evaluation process of a deep learning-based futures price prediction model. The model employs a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) architecture, utilizing high-frequency quantitative features to predict short-term fluctuations in futures prices. Through training and testing on over 2 million 1-minute frequency futures data points, the model achieved an Information Coefficient (IC) of 0.146 on the test set, demonstrating good predictive capability.

## 1. Model Architecture and Principles

### 1.1 Model Selection and Design Philosophy

This research adopts a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) as the core prediction model, a choice based on thorough theoretical analysis and practical considerations:

#### 1.1.1 Applicability Analysis for Time Series Prediction

In the field of financial time series prediction, traditional statistical methods such as ARIMA and GARCH linear models often struggle to capture complex nonlinear relationships. Futures market price fluctuations are influenced by multiple factors, including macroeconomic indicators, supply-demand relationships, investor sentiment, and technical indicators, with complex nonlinear interactions among these factors.

FNN can effectively model these complex nonlinear relationships through its multi-layer nonlinear transformation capability:

- **Feature Space Mapping**: FNN can map the original 131-dimensional feature space to higher-dimensional hidden spaces, discovering patterns not easily detectable in the original feature space
- **Nonlinear Fitting Capability**: Through combinations of multi-layer perceptrons, FNN can fit arbitrarily complex nonlinear functions, crucial for capturing complex dynamic characteristics of futures prices
- **Feature Interaction Learning**: Unlike traditional linear models, FNN can automatically learn interaction relationships between features without manual feature combination design

#### 1.1.2 Computational Efficiency and Real-time Considerations

In high-frequency trading environments, computational efficiency and real-time performance of models are crucial. Compared to other deep learning models, FNN has significant computational advantages:

**Comparison with RNN/LSTM:**

- **Parallel Computing Capability**: All FNN layers can be computed in parallel, while RNN/LSTM requires sequential processing, making FNN more efficient on GPUs
- **Gradient Propagation Stability**: FNN avoids gradient vanishing or exploding problems in RNNs, making training more stable
- **Memory Usage Efficiency**: FNN doesn't need to maintain hidden states, making memory usage more efficient

**Comparison with Transformer:**

- **Parameter Count Control**: FNN has relatively fewer parameters (77,000 parameters), facilitating deployment and maintenance
- **Inference Speed**: FNN's forward propagation process is simpler, enabling faster inference
- **Training Stability**: FNN training is relatively stable, requiring no complex optimization techniques

#### 1.1.3 Generalization Capability and Overfitting Control

Futures markets are characterized by high noise and strong non-stationarity, placing high demands on model generalization capability. FNN achieves good generalization performance through various regularization techniques:

- **Structured Regularization**: Through layer-wise decreasing network structure (256→128→64), achieving hierarchical feature representation
- **Dropout Regularization**: Randomly dropping some neurons during training, forcing the model to learn more robust feature representations
- **Weight Decay**: Constraining model weights through L2 regularization to prevent overfitting to training data
- **Early Stopping**: Early stopping strategy based on validation set performance to avoid overtraining

### 1.2 Network Architecture Design

#### 1.2.1 Overall Architecture Design Philosophy

```
Input Layer (138 dims) → Hidden Layer 1 (256) → Hidden Layer 2 (128) → Hidden Layer 3 (64) → Output Layer (1)
```

The model adopts a layer-wise decreasing architecture design based on the hierarchical feature representation theory in deep learning:

**Network Depth Selection:**

- **Three Hidden Layer Design**: Based on empirical rules and experimental validation, three-layer networks can effectively balance model complexity and performance
- **Progressive Feature Abstraction**: Each layer performs higher-level feature abstraction based on the previous layer
- **Avoiding Overly Deep Networks**: Features for futures prediction tasks are relatively simple; overly deep networks may lead to overfitting

**Network Width Design:**

- **First Layer (256 dims)**: Expands from 138-dim input to 256 dims, increasing model expressiveness and allowing learning of more complex feature combinations
- **Second Layer (128 dims)**: Performs feature integration and dimensionality reduction, removing redundant information while preserving key features
- **Third Layer (64 dims)**: Further compresses feature space, learning high-level abstract representations
- **Output Layer (1 dim)**: Final regression prediction output

**Parameter Scale Analysis:**

- **Input to Hidden Layer 1**: 138 × 256 + 256 = 35,584 parameters
- **Hidden Layer 1 to Hidden Layer 2**: 256 × 128 + 128 = 32,896 parameters
- **Hidden Layer 2 to Hidden Layer 3**: 128 × 64 + 64 = 8,256 parameters
- **Hidden Layer 3 to Output Layer**: 64 × 1 + 1 = 65 parameters
- **Total Parameters**: 77,697 parameters (moderate scale, convenient for training and deployment)

#### 1.2.2 Activation Functions and Regularization Mechanisms

```python
class FNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=138, hidden_dims=[256, 128, 64], 
                 dropout_rate=0.2, activation='relu', batch_norm=True):
        # Activation function: ReLU
        self.activation = nn.ReLU()
        
        # Batch normalization layers
        self.batch_norms = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_dim) for hidden_dim in hidden_dims
        ])
        
        # Dropout layers
        self.dropouts = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Dropout(dropout_rate) for _ in hidden_dims
        ])
```

**Batch Normalization Formula:**

```
μ_B = (1/m) * Σ(x_i)        # Batch mean
σ²_B = (1/m) * Σ(x_i - μ_B)²  # Batch variance
x̂_i = (x_i - μ_B) / √(σ²_B + ε)  # Standardization
y_i = γ * x̂_i + β           # Scaling and shifting
```

**Dropout Regularization:**

Dropout is set to 0.2 ratio, based on the following considerations:

1. **Preventing Overfitting**: Randomly dropping 20% of neurons forces the model to learn more robust feature representations
2. **Improving Generalization**: Enhancing model generalization capability through randomness
3. **Model Ensemble Effect**: Dropout can be viewed as an ensemble of multiple sub-networks, improving prediction stability
4. **Moderate Drop Rate**: 0.2 ratio provides regularization effects without overly affecting information transfer

**Weight Initialization Strategy:**

Kaiming initialization method, specifically optimized for ReLU activation functions:

```python
def _init_weights(self):
    for layer in self.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):
            nn.init.kaiming_normal_(layer.weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')
            if layer.bias is not None:
                nn.init.constant_(layer.bias, 0)
```

**Advantages of Kaiming Initialization:**

- **Variance Preservation**: Maintains variance consistency during forward and backward propagation
- **Gradient Stability**: Effectively avoids gradient explosion or vanishing problems
- **Fast Convergence**: Good initialization helps models converge quickly to optimal solutions

#### 1.2.3 Loss Function and Optimization Strategy

**Loss Function Design:**

```python
# Main loss: Mean Squared Error
loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs.squeeze(), labels)

# Regularization loss
reg_loss = model.get_regularization_loss(l2_lambda=weight_decay)
total_loss = loss + reg_loss
```

**Main Loss Function Analysis:**

Reasons for choosing Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the main loss function:

1. **Regression Task Applicability**: MSE is a classic loss function for regression problems, suitable for continuous value prediction
2. **Good Mathematical Properties**: MSE function is continuous and differentiable, convenient for gradient optimization
3. **Error Sensitivity**: MSE is more sensitive to large errors, helping the model focus on prediction accuracy
4. **Statistical Significance**: MSE corresponds to maximum likelihood estimation, with clear statistical interpretation

**Mathematical Expression of MSE Loss Function:**

```
MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y_true - y_pred)²
```

**Regularization Loss Mechanism:**

L2 regularization is added based on the following considerations:

1. **Overfitting Prevention**: L2 regularization prevents model overfitting to training data by penalizing large weight values
2. **Weight Smoothing**: Encourages the model to learn smoother weight distributions, improving generalization capability
3. **Feature Selection**: L2 regularization helps suppress weights of unimportant features, achieving implicit feature selection

**Implementation of Regularization Loss:**

```python
def get_regularization_loss(self, l2_lambda=1e-5):
    reg_loss = torch.tensor(0.0)
    for param in self.parameters():
        reg_loss += l2_lambda * torch.norm(param, 2) ** 2
    return reg_loss
```

**Optimizer Configuration and Selection:**

**Reasons for Choosing Adam Optimizer:**

1. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Adam combines advantages of AdaGrad and RMSprop, capable of adaptively adjusting learning rates
2. **Momentum Mechanism**: Combines first-order and second-order momentum, providing better stability during optimization
3. **Sparse Gradient Handling**: Strong capability in handling sparse gradients, suitable for high-dimensional feature spaces
4. **Empirical Performance**: Stable performance and fast convergence in deep learning tasks

**Adam Optimizer Update Rules:**

```
m_t = β₁ * m_{t-1} + (1 - β₁) * g_t        # First-order momentum
v_t = β₂ * v_{t-1} + (1 - β₂) * g_t²       # Second-order momentum
m̂_t = m_t / (1 - β₁^t)                     # Bias correction
v̂_t = v_t / (1 - β₂^t)                     # Bias correction
θ_t = θ_{t-1} - α * m̂_t / (√v̂_t + ε)     # Parameter update
```

**Hyperparameter Configuration:**

- **Learning Rate (α = 0.001)**:
  - Experimentally validated optimal learning rate
  - Ensures both convergence speed and avoids oscillation
  - Suitable for typical Adam optimizer range

- **Weight Decay (λ = 1e-5)**:
  - Mild regularization strength, balancing fitting capability and generalization
  - Avoids underfitting caused by overly strong regularization

- **Adam Hyperparameters (β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999)**:
  - Uses PyTorch default values, validated through extensive experiments
  - β₁ controls first-order momentum decay rate
  - β₂ controls second-order momentum decay rate

**Learning Rate Scheduling Strategy:**

Cosine Annealing Scheduler:

```python
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=100)
```

**Advantages of Cosine Annealing:**

1. **Smooth Decay**: Learning rate decays smoothly according to cosine function, avoiding sudden learning rate changes
2. **Periodic Restart**: Provides lower learning rates in later training stages, facilitating fine-tuning
3. **Theoretical Guarantee**: Has theoretical convergence guarantees in convex optimization problems

**Gradient Clipping Mechanism:**

```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

**Functions of Gradient Clipping:**

1. **Preventing Gradient Explosion**: Limits gradient norm to prevent gradient explosion during training
2. **Training Stability**: Improves training process stability, avoiding excessive parameter updates
3. **Convergence Guarantee**: Helps models converge more stably to optimal solutions

### 1.3 Model Theoretical Foundation

#### 1.3.1 Universal Approximation Theorem

According to the universal approximation theorem, a single hidden layer neural network with sufficient width can approximate any continuous function. This model adopts a three hidden layer design, theoretically capable of learning more complex feature representations and nonlinear mapping relationships.

#### 1.3.2 Feature Learning Mechanism

FNN learns key features for futures price prediction through the following mechanisms:

1. **Feature Combination**: Lower layers learn linear combinations of basic features
2. **Nonlinear Transformation**: Introduces nonlinearity through ReLU activation functions
3. **Hierarchical Representation**: Deep networks progressively learn more abstract feature representations
4. **Regularization Constraints**: Avoids overfitting through dropout and weight decay

```python
def _handle_missing_values(self):
    # 1. Forward fill
    feature_data = feature_data.ffill()
    
    # 2. Backward fill
    feature_data = feature_data.bfill()
    
    # 3. Zero fill
    feature_data = feature_data.fillna(0)
    
    # 4. Remove samples with missing labels
    self.data = self.data[~label_missing]
```

**Outlier Handling:**

```python
def _handle_outliers(self):
    # 1. Handle infinite values
    inf_mask = np.isinf(self.features) | np.isnan(self.features)
    self.features[inf_mask] = 0
    
    # 2. Percentile truncation
    q99 = np.percentile(valid_data, 99.9)
    q01 = np.percentile(valid_data, 0.1)
    col_data[col_data > q99] = q99
    col_data[col_data < q01] = q01
```

#### 2.2.2 Feature Standardization

RobustScaler is used for feature standardization, more robust to outliers compared to StandardScaler:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

# Standardization using median and interquartile range
scaler = RobustScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

**RobustScaler Principles:**

- Centering: Uses median instead of mean
- Scaling: Uses interquartile range (IQR) instead of standard deviation
- Formula: `X_scaled = (X - median) / IQR`

#### 2.2.3 Time Feature Engineering

**Cyclical Feature Encoding:**

```python
# Convert time to cyclical features, maintaining continuity
hour_sin = np.sin(2 * np.pi * hour / 24)
hour_cos = np.cos(2 * np.pi * hour / 24)
```

**Trading Session Features:**

```python
# Day session determination
day_mask = (
    ((hour == 9) | (hour == 10) & (minute <= 15)) |  # 9:00-10:15
    ((hour == 10) & (minute >= 30) | (hour == 11) & (minute <= 30)) |  # 10:30-11:30
    ((hour == 13) & (minute >= 30) | (hour == 14) | (hour == 15) & (minute == 0))  # 13:30-15:00
)

# Night session determination
night_mask = (
    (hour >= 21) |  # 21:00-23:59
    (hour <= 2) |   # 00:00-02:00

)
```

### 2.3 Data Splitting Strategy

    # Test set: data after 2024-12-15
    test_data = data[data['datetime'] >= test_date]
    train_val_data = data[data['datetime'] < test_date]
    
    # Train and validation sets split by date
    unique_dates = train_val_data['datetime'].dt.date.unique()
    n_train_dates = int(len(unique_dates) * train_val_split_ratio)
    
    train_end_date = unique_dates[n_train_dates - 1]
    train_data = train_val_data[train_val_data['datetime'].dt.date <= train_end_date]
    val_data = train_val_data[train_val_data['datetime'].dt.date > train_end_date]
```
